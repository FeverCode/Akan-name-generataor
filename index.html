            <p>Akan (Twi, Asante) names are the names used by the Akan people of Ghana and the Ivory Coast, who are
                frequently naming their baby boys and baby girls after the day of the week in which they were born and
                the order of birth for each of them, like first born Píèsíe, second born for baby boy Mǎnu/ for baby
                girl Máanu etc. See also, <a href="https://www.thenamemeaning.com/origin/african/">African origin </a>

            <p>Akan name generator takes a user's birthday on the form provided and calculates the day of the week they
                were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. This app will take in a user's
                year of birth, month of birth, day of birth and select gender. Using a formula assigned, it will be
                possible to determine the exact day of the week the user was born
                and give them an Akan name based on their gender.</p>
            <p>Below is a list of Akan names according to the day of the week you were born</p>
